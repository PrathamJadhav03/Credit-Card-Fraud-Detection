# Detecting Fraudulent Credit Card Transactions with Machine Learning
### The Challenge
In the ever-growing world of digital payments, credit card fraud has become a significant concern for banks and financial institutions. With the rise of new and sophisticated techniques employed by fraudsters, it's crucial to implement proactive monitoring and fraud prevention mechanisms. This project aims to tackle this challenge by leveraging machine learning models to accurately predict fraudulent credit card transactions.

### The Dataset
The dataset used in this project is obtained from the [Kaggle Website](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) and comprises 284,807 credit card transactions, of which 492 are fraudulent. This dataset is highly imbalanced, with the positive class (frauds) accounting for only 0.172% of the total transactions. To maintain confidentiality, the dataset has been modified using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), where features like 'time' and 'amount' represent the seconds elapsed between the first transaction and subsequent transactions, and the transaction amount, respectively. The remaining features (V1, V2, V3, up to V28) are the principal components obtained from PCA.

### The Approach
The project follows a structured pipeline, beginning with data understanding and exploratory data analysis (EDA). During EDA, we perform univariate and bivariate analyses, followed by feature transformations, if necessary. Since the dataset consists of Gaussian variables, Z-scaling may not be required, but we can check for skewness and mitigate it to avoid potential issues during model building.

Next, we split the data into train and test sets, employing k-fold cross-validation for validation purposes. Choosing an appropriate k value ensures that the minority class (fraudulent transactions) is correctly represented in the test folds.

In the model-building and hyperparameter tuning phase, we experiment with different machine learning models and fine-tune their hyperparameters until we achieve the desired level of performance on the given dataset. We also explore various sampling techniques to improve model performance on the imbalanced data.

Finally, we evaluate the models using appropriate evaluation metrics. Since accurately identifying fraudulent transactions is more crucial than identifying non-fraudulent ones, we choose an evaluation metric that reflects this business goal.

### The Impact
By successfully developing a robust machine learning model for credit card fraud detection, we can assist banks and financial institutions in reducing time-consuming manual reviews, costly chargebacks and fees, and denials of legitimate transactions. This proactive approach not only enhances customer trust and credibility but also contributes to substantial financial savings for these institutions.
